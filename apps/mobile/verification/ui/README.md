# Offline UI verification

`branch-picker` exercises the native new-session branch selector without an account:
repository defaults, pagination during case-insensitive search, selection and back
cancellation, long names, failed-load retry, and empty repositories. It captures
English light/dark screenshots and video. `share-probe.py --branches --app <app>`
exercises the real Share Extension's cached branch search and selected-branch inbox
payload, then verifies missing-cache handoff preserves the shared text. Run that
probe with `--appearance light` and `--appearance dark`. Native `create-session`,
`github-mentions`, and `share` checks cover selection boundaries, paged GitHub
responses, credential isolation and account/workspace cache separation.

`edit-message` exercises the production last-user-message context menu and full-screen
editor in English light/dark appearances. It checks cancellation preserving the chat
draft, removing an original attachment, adding a file through paste, rejected resend
retaining edits, and successful replacement. Screenshots and video capture the states.
The service boundary is synthetic; no cloud history is rewritten. Protocol tests cover
eligibility, server-owned history replacement and non-replay of uncertain requests.

`composer-fullscreen` types past the chat input's inline cap, expands it in place to
full screen, checks the upward growth and format bar, collapses it, then sends from full
screen. It uses the offline chat-success fixture in English light/dark.

`--suite chat-kit` exercises the Swift Package migration through the
production streaming transcript, standalone Composer sheet and attachment send
handoff. It retains English light/dark coverage, screenshots and video. Run
`pnpm verify:native --case chat-kit` separately for public Swift API style
isolation, remeasurement, attachment actions and identity checks.

`markdown` also drags selection handles across adjacent visible Markdown rows and
across table cells, checks the actual clipboard (including table tabs/newlines),
and replaces the transcript to verify stale selections are cleared. The Selection
Fixture uses production rendering without account or cloud access. User bubbles,
tool rows and unloaded history form selection boundaries; changing visible group
membership clears selection. Table selections keep their upstream group and menu.

Pinned [Litext](https://github.com/Lakr233/Litext) 3.6.2 uses UIKit's public `UITextSelectionDisplayInteraction`
for highlights/handles and `UITextLoupeSession` on iOS 17 and later. `markdown`
checks one system display with two handles and no visible custom handles, and
captures the loupe while long presses and cross-row/table
handle drags are still held, then checks the released menu and real clipboard.
`file-selection` provides focused selection acceptance; `file-preview` also exercises held word selection and copy in Markdown documents
opened from browser, chat and process hosts. Review the held screenshots and
videos in both appearances; a clipboard assertion alone does not prove the loupe
renders correctly. Its appearance belongs to the tested OS runtime.

`markdown` and `file-preview` include native Ruby annotations in both appearances.
The chat check also verifies annotation readings, selectable base text and increased
line height during streaming and after completion. The `local-store` native check
covers parsed Ruby in lists, headings, tables and links, with literal code and
incomplete or unsupported markup preserved.

`session-share` exercises the production SwiftUI conversation-sharing Form with an
independently resettable Debug source: default scope, sub-conversation selection,
automatic link copying, disabled Done during publication, capture/upload/publish
progress, failed upload retaining its selected scope with no link, retry, stable-link
updates, system sharing, reset confirmation/cancellation and revocation. Both
English appearances capture screenshots and video; no live share is published.
Protocol tests separately run the production exporter and publication state
machine against an in-memory control plane and upload transport.

`session-delete` and `session-delete-pad` use the production archived list,
conversation header and home list/sidebar with the Home preview catalog. They
verify confirmation cancellation, a rejected delete with the row retained,
successful retry, and navigation back (or clearing iPad detail) after deletion.
The first archived deletion fails at the injected service boundary. Each launch
resets that fixture; both English appearances capture screenshots and video.
No cloud records or machine worktrees are deleted by these checks.

`appearance` exercises preset accents, UIKit's custom color picker, persisted
custom color after a cold launch, the three-column native app-icon grid, actual
system icon switching and a Debug-only rejected-change fixture. ColorPickerUIService
is not traversable by AXe; the case uses visually confirmed iPhone 17 Pro palette
coordinates and verifies the resulting UserDefaults value plus restored UI.
Both appearances record screenshots and video, without account or cloud access.

`--case scroll-edge` scrolls deterministic chat content beneath the native
composer and raises the software keyboard in both appearances. It checks keyboard
clearance and captures the chat bottom edge fade (UIKit's bottom edge is hidden) for visual review. Run a fresh native
build: an old binary or a passing layout assertion does not prove the fade renders.

All UI baselines run without login, user data, cloud credentials, or a connected
machine. `EXPO_PUBLIC_UI_VERIFY=1` is inlined into the JS bundle and prevents
account restoration before Keychain/SQLite reads and disables login. PR CI
builds a Release Simulator app with that flag and an embedded Hermes bundle;
`--embedded` then launches the app without Metro. Local full inventory still
uses a Debug app plus one owned Metro. Both paths require the `ui-verify-ready`
marker before any interaction. Native image fixtures additionally require the
`--ui-verify` launch argument. No production credentials are used. The managed
verification Simulator is reused without erasing between leases.

The `pull-request` case also exercises authorization retry, empty checks, a rejected
comment retaining its draft followed by successful publication to the local fixture,
and an investigation prompt appended without replacing the session draft. Native
GitHub transport checks intercept requests and never publish real comments.
The PR detail captures blue/red addition/deletion totals and Octicons for open,
merged, closed and draft states. It checks the icon-only GitHub button's 44 pt
target, VoiceOver label and existing open action.

## Run locally

After the offline ready marker, the runner opens each Debug scene with
`lody:///debug?verifyCase=<preview-id>&request=<unique-id>`, reusing the same
menu action without scrolling or tapping the Debug list. Only the offline
verification bundle handles these parameters; each request opens once.
Home cases keep their native launch fixtures. Use `UI.open_case` for later fixture
entries and relaunches as well; no case should scroll the Debug menu merely to
reach its fixture. Results include `caseEntrySeconds` and `checkSeconds`.

The runner establishes English and software-keyboard mode once per batch.
Cases reuse that baseline. `UI.axe("type", text)` / `UI.type_into` submit text
through one AXe composite HID batch rather than individual key submissions;
do not repeat keyboard setup, switch IMEs, or erase/retry a mismatched draft.
A mismatch fails immediately. Individual software-key taps remain only when the
specific key interaction is under test (for example, the `$` mention trigger).
Retain keyboard geometry assertions where keyboard behavior is the requirement.
Recording starts after shared startup is ready, immediately before scene entry.

`session-search` and `session-search-pad` run the production Inbox/sidebar and
session find with isolated cached fixtures. They cover title/path/branch and
Markdown body matches, excluded tool/URL metadata, snippets, real rendered
highlights (including code and tables), keyboard behavior, navigation, closing,
folded thoughts, and an older match outside the initial 50-entry window. The
older match becomes navigable only after the user explicitly loads that page.
Both appearances record screenshots and video. `verify:native --case local-store`
also runs the real Markdown parser and SQLite migration/failure checks via SwiftPM.
The find checks also cover two-row controls, 44 pt buttons, stable input width
across result changes and retained message position after closing. Review the
video for the expanding/fading header and its keyboard transition in both hosts.

`mcp-files` verifies uploaded text/PDF/video previews, video playback, download
retry, missing/pending files, user attachments and cancellation in both appearances.
It uses `ffmpeg` to create an offline MP4 in the leased Simulator; no account or
cloud upload is involved.

The `permission` case also opens the production question card with three offline
questions. It checks single/multiple choices, previous/next navigation, free text,
the complete answer payload, failed-upload retry, remote answer dismissal and
composer draft retention in both appearances. Screenshots and video cover each
answer state; no real agent request is dispatched.

If a normal signed Debug app is already built, each verification command can lease
its own iPhone 17 Pro / iOS 27.0 device from the `Lody * Verify` pool. The documented
command without `--case` or `--batch` is that phone lease only. Pad-only cases
(`ipad`, `ipad-chrome`, `native-shell`, `native-collection`) stay behind an explicit
`--case` so they lease an iPad instead of asserting a wide screen on an iPhone.

```sh
pnpm verify:native
pnpm verify:ui --app /absolute/path/to/Lody.app
pnpm verify:ui --suite core --embedded --app /absolute/path/to/Lody.app --output .artifacts/ui-core
pnpm verify:ui --case ipad --app /absolute/path/to/Lody.app --output .artifacts/ipad
# One Metro, three concurrent leased Simulators, all batches:
pnpm verify:ui --parallel --app /absolute/path/to/Lody.app --output .artifacts/ui-parallel
pnpm verify:ui --app /absolute/path/to/Lody.app --suite send-reliability --output .artifacts/send-reliability
```

`ipad-sidebar` verifies the relocated Workspace, view/settings and new-session
actions independently, including long workspace names, view changes (the By
Machine title heading its project outline and collapsing it on tap) and workspace switching in both
appearances.

The current `ipad-chrome` case leases an iPad Air 11-inch (M2), separately from
phone batches. It exercises the production `PadHomeScreen`: independent native
sidebar, selected session and outline restoration, project push/back with the
navigating row held until return, top search,
top workspace switch, bottom view/settings/new-session actions, and a window-level creation form.
A wide detail keeps the 760 pt reading column centered, but the transcript
scroll view stays full-bleed so the vertical indicator sits on the screen edge.
Switching to an empty workspace must remove the old conversation; a real
`lody://` system deep link then resolves the original workspace and opens its
session in the right column without adding a phone route. The creation flow uses
offline service outcomes and retains its first message in that same column.
Screenshots and video cover light/dark states; no cloud turn is dispatched.

`NativeSidebar` and `NativeGroupedList` are separate containers. They share row
content, row interactions, and the Inbox/Project business models, not device
layout. The native `list` check exercises shared content at both densities;
`home` verifies the iPhone grouped host. The older `ipad` script records the
superseded panel-local sheet experiment and is not current business acceptance.

`devices` covers the workspace's status dot and device submenu, mixed/offline/unknown
states, the current session's device subtitle, and recovery in
the open new-session sheet. The recovery scene starts with an options-load failure,
then waits for its project computer; another computer coming online must not
enable Send or replace the selection. It preserves edited text and an attachment
through recovery and Project/Chat switching. `devices-pad` exercises the workspace
indicator and device menu in the iPad sidebar. Both run in English, light and dark, with video.
The Debug-only boundary reads `ui-device-presence` and `ui-device-options-error`
from the local fixture cache; no credentials, cloud traffic, or real turn are used.
Production liveness comes from the workspace ephemeral presence stream, not the
registered catalog or the app's cloud connection. Transport/TTL behavior is checked
separately by the machine-presence and data-runtime behavioral checks.

For a verified build, wrap the build and checks so Xcode cannot select a personal
Simulator. The wrapper exposes its device as `LODY_VERIFY_UDID`; `pnpm
verify:build` builds for that lease and prints the App path, and nested verify
commands reuse the same lease:

```sh
pnpm verify:simulator --name 'File Preview' -- zsh -euc '
  pnpm verify:native
  pnpm verify:ui --app "$(pnpm --silent verify:build)" \
    --case file-preview --output .artifacts/file-preview
'
```

`pnpm verify:build` writes the App path to stdout and progress plus the
xcodebuild log location to stderr; `--json` returns the app, build-cache and log
paths together. The build cache stays in Xcode's DerivedData, never under
`.artifacts`.

The allocator serializes selection and locks each leased device. It only considers
available, matching `Lody * Verify` devices; personal devices, other projects and
legacy runtimes are never candidates. Reserve that name pattern for disposable
verification devices. A shutdown candidate is renamed to the current
verification, then booted. If none is free, one device is created.
Release shuts it down but keeps it for the next run. A device left booted after an
interrupted managed run can be reclaimed once its lock is gone; an untracked booted
device is treated as occupied.

`--udid` remains available for CI or an explicitly owned Simulator. Supplying it
bypasses leasing, rename and shutdown, so its caller owns the full lifecycle.
Do not call `simctl create` directly for local verification.

Requires Python 3, AXe 1.8.0, Xcode 26.5 and the workspace dependencies.
`--case layout` selects one case (still both appearances). UI verification runs
only in English (`en`, `en_US`); `--language en` remains accepted for existing
callers. Do not add separate Chinese verification runs. `--port 8098` changes
the isolated Metro port; occupied ports are rejected. `--output PATH` selects an
artifact directory; a previous run at that path is deleted and replaced, so reuse
the same path across retries and pick a distinct path only for an A/B comparison.
Keep one build cache per checkout: `pnpm verify:build` reuses the workspace's
Xcode DerivedData, so a rebuild after a source change reuses the previous
products. Do not pass a per-task `-derivedDataPath` and do not copy the checkout
into the temp directory to build; both leave a multi-GB directory that nothing
reviews. `pnpm verify:clean` reports those leftovers with their sizes, and
`--apply` removes them. The runner owns only its Metro
process group and app process. A small host-only CoreSimulator helper disconnects
hardware keyboard input for the leased device so keyboard geometry is actually
tested. No global Simulator preferences are changed. It never shuts down another
task's locked Simulator or Metro.

## Baseline inventory

`quick-replies` exercises the production composer and Settings editor: idle-only
visibility, draft preservation, full-message sending and explicit failure retry,
stable transcript/input geometry across repeated first-character and last-delete transitions,
adding/editing/reordering/deleting replies, and local persistence after process
restart. Both English appearances record screenshots and video; no cloud turn
is dispatched.

`context-chip` reuses that scene and cycles its Preview fixture through
connecting, ready, simulator and unavailable. The composer's single context
chip must keep a separator before the suggestions and follow its label width.
It collapses to its icon while a draft exists and stays when work hides the
suggestions. `run.mp4` is the evidence for the width and text morphs.
It also pushes a fresh conversation with a Simulator chip already present and
returns to the original row. The native `context-chip` check samples presentation
geometry through first display and repeated identical updates, rejecting a
second entrance animation or a restarted horizontal displacement. It also
delivers replies after a real navigation push has begun, checking that the row
moves with its page instead of independently expanding during the transition.

`pull-request` opens Debug → GitHub PR / CI 预览 with an injected OSS-shaped
projection. It captures the native chat entry, PR summary, grouped checks,
individual check and comment editor in both appearances, then verifies native
back gestures and draft retention when the preview declines to post. It does
not authenticate to GitHub, publish comments, dispatch assistant turns or claim
live check/log retrieval.

`smooth-scroll` exercises cached history replacement, anchor preservation while
reading, streamed paragraphs/code, drag interruption and the production process
Sheet. It also drags beyond the top during live updates and checks that neither
the held rubber band nor its release snaps to the resting boundary.
It records video plus opt-in Debug-only UIKit geometry at display refresh
cadence (`--ui-verify-scroll`); the check requires intermediate scroll/height
frames in both hosts. Review the video for clipping and flashes before claiming
visual smoothness. The probe contains fixture IDs and geometry only.

`--case root-reuse` leaves the model popover open in both the chat and creation-sheet
hosts, resets to Debug, and opens another fixture with the same PID. The shared
native composer dismisses its owned popover when it leaves the window.

Ordinary cases reset the native navigation stack to a fresh Debug root, unmounting
the previous fixture and its presentation sessions while retaining the App process.
The runner asserts the PID is unchanged and records `appLifecycle` / `appPid`.
Home fixtures still start fresh to reset their account/workspace provider state;
changing native startup probes or recovering a failed case also restarts explicitly.
The reset hook exists only in the offline development bundle and is invoked through
the current Simulator inspector. Both light and dark appearances run with default text size and English system controls. Product
copy is asserted through `catalog.text` / `catalog.plural`, which read the same
`apps/mobile/locales` catalog the app ships, so a scene proves the selected
language rather than a hardcoded sentence. Fixture content remains Chinese. Composer requests remain pending until the driver taps
Complete Request, so request timing cannot hide the busy state. These scenes
exercise production native draft contracts; they do not claim to cover cloud
persistence or Machine RPC. Those retain their existing behavior tests.

`verify:native` reuses chat, watchdog, local-store, status-label rendering,
composer, attachment and inline-diff checks. The former ChatMarkdown-specific drawing and
block-selection tests referenced a deleted renderer and have been retired;
Markdown is rendered by the actual chat baseline, with screenshots/video for
review. There is no pixel-diff gate yet: screenshots are evidence, not automatic
proof of typography or animation quality.

`composer` and `home` additionally sample the rendered card inset and adjacent
sheet material, requiring a visible color difference. This covers the compact
and expanded creation hosts (`NativeGroupedList` and `NativePagedList`) and the
picker pushed inside the expanded sheet. Review the captured light/dark images
as well; the color check alone does not establish visual correctness.

## CI and future UI changes

`.github/workflows/verify.yml` runs Checks, Native behavior, one signed
Release Simulator build of the fixture app (`EXPO_PUBLIC_UI_VERIFY=1`, Hermes
embedded, expo-updates off), and two parallel Offline iOS UI jobs on PRs and
pushes to main. Those jobs install the same `.app` and run `--embedded` with
`--suite core-home` (`onboarding`, `inbox`, `navigation`) or `--suite core-send`
(`send`, `send-handoff`, `composer-success`). Light appearance only, first
failure stops that job, and video is not required. The full phone inventory,
dark appearance, performance, animation, and pad cases stay local on a Debug
app plus Metro; they are not a PR gate. Configure Checks, Native behavior,
Build iOS Simulator, `Offline iOS UI (core-home)`, and
`Offline iOS UI (core-send)` as required checks. Remove the old three-batch or
single `core` job names or PRs will wait for checks that no longer run.

`--suite core` selects all six cases locally. `--embedded` skips Metro and
relaunches the app for each case. `--batch pages|send|chat`
keeps the local grouping; `--case` still runs a single case; omitting all three
runs every phone case in both appearances. Standalone Home/Licenses/Navigation
run in the same worker and bundle as the other pages. Local `--parallel` shares
one Metro across three leased Simulators. Each worker installs once, changes
fixture mode with native launch arguments, and records its own
results/video/screenshots under `pages/`, `send/`, or `chat/`. The parent writes
combined `results.json` and worker exit codes/times in `batches.json`; workers
cannot stop the parent Metro. Navigation reload uses the target device inspector
instead of broadcasting to every app. `--parallel` owns its leases, so do not
supply `--udid` or wrap it in a single-device lease. Build separately with
`verify:simulator`, then run `--parallel` against that signed App.

The runner enables request diagnostics only for its owned Metro. `metro.log`
records manifest/status request starts, completion/connection-close, status and
duration without headers, query parameters or bodies. A successful start only
waits for status and prewarms the bundle once. On failures, `metro-startup.json`
and per-case `metro-failure.json` probe host-side status and manifest HEAD/GET with
10-second deadlines; they do not prove Simulator reachability. Compare these
with the five-minute `native.log` and failure screenshot to distinguish no
incoming request, an unfinished server response, and app-side failure.
`environment.json` records Node, Xcode and AXe versions, the selected suite or
batch, appearances, and whether video is required. UI artifacts contain
results.json, per-case logs, screenshots and accessibility trees, plus video when
the run requires it, including failures. A failed case always takes a Simulator
framebuffer screenshot first (`failure.png`, also copied to `failures/`); that
does not wait on AXe. The first `describe-ui` after a fresh Simulator boot
retries until AXe's XCTest session exists. Later AXe commands retry the same way
when that session dies. A command that hangs restarts the simulator
`testmanagerd` before the retry, because killing the client alone leaves the
next `describe-ui` stuck on the same session. `navigation` dismisses the first-open SpringBoard alert
by tapping Open without waiting on `describe-ui`, which hangs on that dialog, and
does that only once so later links are not delayed by missing-label probes.
Embedded `navigation` does two cold relaunches and one unknown-URL return, and
is allowed 600s. `send` and `send-handoff` are allowed 300s. Later send drafts are letter-only, and
`type_into` accepts an all-caps commit because AXe can hold Shift. Embedded core
send skips throw-motion sampling; CI Simulators miss the 50ms / blend thresholds. Core suites keep running after one case
fails so inbox and later send cases still report. English `type_into` retypes when the
field disagrees even if there is no Next keyboard. `navigation` is allowed 480s because
three cold relaunches plus catalog links overrun a 360s cap on CI. Embedded
runs skip the Metro `Page.reload` tail of that case. The two CI UI matrix jobs
keep running after one fails. CI uploads those plus a job-level `simctl io screenshot`
as `ui-failure-*` when a Simulator job fails. Missing scenes and timeouts fail the
job. A core-suite run does not fail only because `run.mp4` is absent. No login
or distribution signing secret is used.

For each new UI behavior:

1. Add/reset a deterministic scene under development-only Debug. Reuse production
   views and the existing `present` contract; inject data or service outcomes at
   the owning boundary. Do not duplicate a production screen into a fake UI.
2. Add a runnable user-visible assertion and register it in the runner. New scenes
   must run independently without earlier cases or login. Do not add a case to
   `--suite core` unless it is one of the daily product paths.
3. Reproduce bugs with the original precondition; avoid internal constant-table
   snapshots. Prefer element-relative geometry and bounded state waits.
4. For shared UI, exercise each real host (e.g. chat and creation sheet). Add
   navigation/return integration cases when those boundaries change.
5. Review screenshots for appearance changes and video for keyboard/scroll/gesture
   changes. Baseline updates require review; never auto-approve a failed comparison.

Remote settings details now have an independent offline scene. It injects service
outcomes and checks the submitted values, but does not claim live cloud persistence.
Product catalog navigation and live cloud workflows still need separate acceptance.

The `settings` case also checks native Agent subscription meters, independent Spark
limits, read-only viewing, missing usage and custom-API exclusion. Pulling to refresh
first simulates an offline fetch with cached usage, then reconnects with a changed
percentage. Its fixtures pass through the production catalog projector; screenshots
and video cover both appearances without provider credentials or live quota queries.

The `live-activity` case uses the offline `debug` workspace and production activity reconciliation, without OneSignal or credentials. It checks the injected settings toggle, a multiple-task overview, permission priority, removal of a completed turn, ending all work and starting again. Island captures background the app first; the Lock Screen captures include the completion summary and its 10-second dismissal. Both appearances record video. It also switches the real app icon from default to Aqua during an active overview, captures the compact/expanded Island and Lock Screen artwork, verifies a newly started activity, and switches back to default. The runner handles the system's Live Activity consent prompt on reused pool devices. Overview links reject an unavailable account, and unavailable session links preserve the current page. Push-to-start and remote background updates still require a real device; these local checks do not establish APNs delivery.

The background case runs via `--case background`, dwelling on the Simulator Home screen for 40 seconds. Counts originate from real offscreen WebView callbacks; cloud events are substituted with local scripts without network or credential access. If the system denies sustained background tasks, this case only verifies retention/restoration and request-failure degradation, and cannot be used to claim that sustained background execution has passed. Prolonged physical-device network connectivity and power consumption require separate real-device testing.

`home`, `licenses`, and `navigation` select the in-memory Auth/Catalog Providers
with the native `--ui-verify-home` launch argument, guarded by `--ui-verify`.
Release fixture builds honor the same flags. They use the same bundle as other
cases, without launching authentication or synchronization. A full worker run
executes them first. New session creation verifies opening, switching 项目 /
对话 via the title segment, and cancelling; projects not bound to a machine do
not read machine configuration or send real messages.

`--case navigation` uses the same offline providers and real `lody:///workspace/sessions/id` URLs. It checks warm links, initial-URL handling after a JS restart, repeated links, links from a settings sheet, workspace switching, unknown URLs, native Back and edge swipes. It also relaunches the process three times per appearance with the offline flags, checking that the workspace button stays visible and stable and leaves room for Settings. Reloading JS preserves `--ui-verify`, unlike a process launch via `openurl`; cold deep-link launches are not covered. The Debug-only navigation probe verifies that a session has exactly one Home beneath it and that returning leaves Home as the only route. Screenshots and video capture the transitions. The live-activity case separately verifies that an unavailable fixture session leaves the current page in place.

The iOS `react-native-screens` patch ignores late sheet-wrapper layout callbacks after the owning controller has been invalidated. The navigation case reproduces this during a settings-sheet dismissal followed by a workspace/session jump. Remove the patch when the installed upstream version handles these stale callbacks.

The native toolbar patches keep items on their owning controller while it is offscreen.
`react-native-screens` declares `hidesBottomBarWhenPushed` before UIKit constructs
the navigation transition, updating it when the controller receives toolbar items.
This preserves UIKit's early Search glass fade instead of starting a second,
late hide animation in `willShow`. `didShow` reconciles the winning controller after
return or cancellation; it must not be the first point that reveals the bar.
`expo-router` retains items on detach, defers item updates until navigation ends,
and prevents offscreen updates from showing the shared toolbar. Do not hide the
toolbar synchronously before push/pop: that removes the system Search fade.
Settings is the reference: Search text and glass blur/fade out during push and
become visible near the end of return. Brief overlap during that native fade is
expected; a stationary duplicate, late reappearance or post-transition residue is not.
The navigation case opens a Home row, cancels an edge pop, then returns.
`--case navigation-toolbar` isolates two successive push/cancel/return cycles and
checks that the restored search still filters the catalog, in both appearances.
Light mode is the reported failure condition; Dark mode is the regression control.
This case also checks cached session opening: the real row action reads SQLite
and prepares native entries before navigation. `opening-*.json` records every
display callback from the first attached frame through return; each opening must
have visible message cells on its first sample and never show the empty loading
label. The recording is still required to judge the actual transition frames.
Review every encoded transition frame in `run.mp4` for continuous Search fading,
no late residue, and correct cancellation recovery. Reject both abrupt removal
and lingering glass; settled accessibility assertions cannot establish this. Remove these
patches once upstream provides this lifecycle coordination.

### 10,000-message performance demo

Settings → Debug → **10,000-message performance test** (`10,000 条消息性能测试` in the UI) loads 5,000 user messages and
5,000 Markdown answers through the production `NativeChat` collection. Near the top, the list loads 50 earlier entries at a time and preserves the
reading position. Measurement runs during scrolling; insertion waits until the
gesture, deceleration or status-bar return has settled. The header exposes loading and end-of-history feedback. Tap the
play button to traverse all history pages first, then run a 20-second scroll at 8,000 pt/s (10 seconds away from the
current position, then back). Start at the bottom for the standard baseline.
The timed run visits part of the 10,000-entry dataset, not every message.

```sh
pnpm verify:ui --app <Debug.app> \
  --case chat-performance --output .artifacts/chat-performance --port 8103
```

The recording starts before navigation. `loading.json` records native prop receipt
to first layout and complete history layout, the initial row count, and individual
measurement slices. It excludes JS fixture generation; complete history time
includes the driven scrolling and waits, so it is not eager-load latency. The check requires 50 complete entries at first paint, real top-edge navigation
to earlier messages, presentation-layer frame continuity during manual pagination,
all 200 contiguous pages, a stable reading position on every prepend, and a visible first message with end-of-history feedback. A slice
targets 4 ms; one indivisible message layout may exceed that budget.

The scroll check repeats three times in each appearance. `performance-summary.json`
contains FPS, p95/max frame interval, over-budget intervals, visited section range,
and memory; `run-1.json` through `run-3.json` contain raw samples. Screenshots and
`run.mp4` capture the UI. Assertions verify the full dataset, both scroll directions,
more than 70,000 pt of travel, the measurement interval, and valid memory samples.
Performance values are reported without an arbitrary pass/fail threshold.

FPS measures `CADisplayLink` main-run-loop callback delivery, not GPU-presented
frames. Memory is the whole App process's `TASK_VM_INFO.phys_footprint` in MiB,
sampled every 250 ms; short spikes between samples can be missed. Baseline is
captured when timed scrolling starts, after all pages have loaded, not an
empty-app baseline. The sampler and video recording add overhead. Simulator Debug results
are regression baselines, not physical-device Release performance or proof of
absence of leaks. Native instrumentation is compiled only in Debug and stops
when its view leaves the window.

### Streaming Markdown pressure checks

`--case chat-stream-performance` drives the production chat with 40 history rows
and 12 seconds of 300 synthetic tokens/s (one token is four UTF-16 units, delivered
in 50 ms batches). It repeats paragraphs, one long paragraph, and one long code
block in both appearances. `stream-summary.json` reports callback FPS, p95 frame
and commit time, text backlog, bottom gap, and catch-up time; `*-samples.json`
retains raw samples. Screenshots and `run.mp4` capture streaming and completion.
Assertions require complete output and final bottom alignment, plus native block
layout parity, unchanged-prefix reuse, and late reference-link resolution. The
probe records `fading` independently of committed text length: long prose must
still animate after 4096 units, and completion must wait for its final fade.
Catch-up time includes that visual drain and the final bottom alignment.

The offscreen scenario first scrolls within the visible prefix of a long reply,
then through earlier history while input and completion continue. It returns near
the frozen tail, then uses the production bottom action. Assertions require zero
Markdown updates during the offscreen interval, a stable displayed prefix,
authoritative completion, and the full latest text without replayed fades on return.
The p95 offscreen callback time and Markdown update count are reported separately;
its overall catch-up time includes the deliberate wait away from the reply.
Visibility uses already measured block bounds: a single block crossing the viewport
continues updating conservatively. This is a Simulator main-run-loop comparison,
not device GPU frame timing.

The same case then holds six syntax prefixes using the Debug toolbar: unfinished
bold, inline code, an incomplete link, a complete link, an unfinished final word,
and the stopped response. Review `syntax-*.png` and the recording. Native probes
also check the actual bold font, plain-text incomplete link, and original-source
restoration after completion. The source remains unchanged in the transcript.

`pnpm --filter @lody-ios/mobile native:assets` bundles pinned Remend for isolated
JavaScriptCore use (no WebView or remote script). `pnpm verify:native --case
markdown-repair` exercises this exact asset, including literal code/escapes,
Unicode, concurrent calls and fail-open behavior. Math repair is disabled to
preserve the native parser's existing math/currency rules.

These are Simulator Debug main-run-loop measurements, not GPU-presented FPS or
physical-device model-token throughput. Compare identical input and appearances;
run `markdown`, `file-preview`, and `smooth-scroll` separately for interaction
regressions. Performance numbers are reported without arbitrary pass thresholds.

### Send animation frame checks

`--case morph` opens the production new-session sheet from offline Home and
checks close, cancelled drag, backdrop dismissal, completed swipe and first-message
handoff in both appearances. Dismissals must remove the Router presentation,
and reopening must remain possible. The send check requires the same composer,
unchanged focus and input state, and adoption within 1.5 pt. Review `run.mp4`
with `transition-events.json` for the system button-to-sheet zoom, reverse zoom
and the source-less send dismissal. `--case sheet-zoom-project` covers the
Project page navigation button, repeated opening/cancellation, and retaining the
owning project route. These fixtures do not send a cloud message.

`send`, `send-handoff`, `send-rounds`, `send-queue`, `send-guide`, `send-transition`, and `send-transition-handoff` enable the `--ui-verify-throw` probe.
It requests the Simulator screen's maximum refresh rate and samples Core Animation
presentation geometry on every `CADisplayLink` callback, through 350ms after the
nominal flight. Each case saves raw `lody-throw-*.json` files and a
`throw-summary.json`: observed FPS, callback gaps, deviation from the designed
path (arc plus settle tail, recorded by the probe), backwards movement during
the flight segment, stationary interior frames, scale, and window-to-cell landing
error. Missing samples, a callback gap over 50ms, or a position discontinuity over
1.5pt fail the check. Tune the curve in `modules/lody-kit/verification/chat/throw-tuner.html`. This measures main-thread callbacks and presentation-layer
state, not GPU-presented FPS; review the accompanying framebuffer video at its
original variable frame timestamps as well. Do not upsample the movie and call
interpolated or duplicated frames additional evidence.

`--case file-preview` exercises embedded Markdown file links in chat and the
process sheet, file-type symbols and VoiceOver actions, rendered Markdown/source
switching, document-relative links, and the shared file-browser preview. It also
checks the shared Expo DOM / Pierre File source renderer and parked WebView reuse with a 240-line code file for two-axis scrolling, target-line highlighting and
automatic positioning, and reopening after interactive dismissal. It also
opens PNG/PDF through presented Quick Look (`openFile`; pull-down dismisses;
the image lightbox is not used) and checks a missing-file error.
The Debug-only `ui-verify-files` reader supplies local fixtures before the cloud
runtime; this case does not claim live Machine RPC or every Quick Look format.
`LODY_VERIFY_FILE_SOURCE_ONLY=1` runs just the document/source, scrolling, line
link and dismissal checks across browser/chat/process hosts, without Quick Look.
Reads wait five seconds (PDF returns immediately): the browser must push a loading
page before content arrives, clear selection on return, ignore a late image read
after returning, and offer retry for a failed read.

The throw uses a native snapshot of the rendered input pixels, including its
material, and crossfades into the user bubble. It no longer redraws the window
synchronously to sample a background color. The probe checks the destination
background's interpolation from transparent to opaque; both appearances fail if
it snaps directly to its destination. Review the framebuffer video for the
source material as well.
Queue fixtures inject service outcomes only; protocol checks additionally verify
real Loro movable-list updates, persist-before-watermark ordering, and no replay
after an uncertain write. They do not claim a connected-machine cloud run.

`send-reliability` runs guide, outbox, local queue preference, queue/interrupt,
ordinary send, and text/attachment handoff in both appearances with video.
`send-guide` holds the native-send service result through durable-write and RPC
stages: only the ACK unlocks the next send. It also checks a retained failure and
same-ID retry, the target ending during preparation, and an ambiguous ACK that
retains the message without a retry action. Native runtime checks separately
exercise these outcomes through real Loro updates and the RPC transport seam.
`outbox` dismisses a production composer sheet before the workspace dispatcher
creates/sends its turn, retains a retryable sync failure, and verifies eight
active sends plus one waiting send, slot reuse and final release. Its local
service outcomes do not establish real cloud delivery or background OS time.

`send-handoff` starts with a real software keyboard and the production
`ComposerSheet`. `send-handoff-delayed` adds 1.2 seconds of destination preparation
latency after dismissal. The same composer remains at its window position with
its draft intact until the destination adopts it, then starts the normal message
flight. Native reports verify identity, input state and geometry at adoption.
The native composer check verifies deferred consumption, one dispatch and draft
restoration. The original `composer-relay` POC remains available for comparison.
These are deterministic latency checks, not a simulation of physical-device Low
Power Mode or proof of device CPU/GPU frame rates.

`send-transition` and `send-transition-handoff` send a long message and five real
local file/image providers through the chat composer and the new-session sheet.
They check equal source/landing height, independent text and attachment expansion,
selection order, image preview, stable history takeover, and a file-only send
without an empty bubble. Both appearances record screenshots and video;
`lody-throw-*.json` samples text geometry and `lody-attachment-*.json` additionally
checks that the destination stays hidden during its flight and lands within 1.5 pt.
The `send` and `send-handoff` cases retain definite failures in the transcript and
retry explicitly. Unknown delivery results are never replayed by this control.

The transition cases also drive per-attachment upload percentages through the
production send subscription. They check 25% and 65%, the verifying spinner,
independent completion and removal before acknowledgement, in both hosts and
appearances. Progress stays on the attachment tile without a status row. These
UI events are injected; the native attachment check separately uses an 8 MiB
loopback upload to prove actual URLSession byte callbacks, and intercepted cloud
requests to check image/file phases, cumulative multipart progress and failure.
`pnpm verify:native --case attachments` owns its local `progress-server.py`
receiver; no account or cloud connection is needed.

### Unified @ references

`--case mention-chat` and `--case mention-sheet` exercise the same native
composer with an offline catalog injected by `ComposerPreviewScreen`. The Debug
entries are **@ 引用交互 · 聊天** and **@ 引用交互 · 新会话**. Both appearances
capture the two-category entry, compact touch autocomplete, full-screen
file/skill search sheets with navigation-owned bottom search on iPhone,
directory navigation/reference, and selection/cancel
returning to the draft and keyboard.

`--case mentions-production` opens the actual chat and new-session screens through
the offline Home fixture. A launch-scoped native provider supplies deterministic
file and skill results; each appearance resets its fixture draft and checks the
complete inserted text. Normal runs query the project's machine for files and
project/global skills. File paths and explicit skill links remain ordinary draft
text and travel through the existing send path.

`project-history-entry` opens the actual signed-in Settings sheet using the offline Home fixture, then checks the sync entry and recoverable disconnected state.

## Acceptance rounds (requirement alignment only)

A visual or interaction requirement alignment — a delivery a reviewer accepts or
rejects item by item — exports one immutable round from a run that already
finished:

```sh
python3 apps/mobile/verification/ui/acceptance-round.py \
  --output .artifacts/ui-parallel/send \
  --title '融合 Plus 的玻璃交互' \
  --requirement '输入框融合后的 Plus 随玻璃按压同步缩放，展开时不出现独立圆形阴影。' \
  --claims /tmp/glass-claims.json
```

The claims file holds only the behaviors this alignment asserts (`id`, `behavior`,
`category`, `cases`, `requiredEvidence`). The exporter copies that run's evidence
into the round's `assets/`, keeps light and dark apart, and refuses to write a
round when a claimed case produced no result or a declared evidence type is
missing; it prints the `lh acceptance run ingest` command. A round is immutable —
a fix exports a new round rather than overwriting one.

Ordinary regression runs are never ingested: `results.json` stays a programmatic
CI gate. Simulator Debug evidence cannot claim physical-device performance,
haptics or cloud persistence, whatever the round says.

Attachment overlays:

- `--case attachment-overlay-chat` and `--case attachment-overlay-sheet` use the
  production composer with real Simulator Photos, seeded with the app icon. They
  check keyboard coverage, retained selection across back/forward navigation,
  attachment import and continued draft editing in both themes.

Attachment authorization regression: `--case attachment-overlay-chat` and
`--case attachment-overlay-sheet` reset Photos permission before each appearance
and use the real system prompt. `--photo-access full|limited|denied|settings`
selects the outcome; `settings` denies first, opens system Settings, then
returns without changing authorization to verify the live continuation. Changing
privacy in Settings can terminate the app and is a separate cold-launch path. Evidence includes the system handoff, restored
recent-photos surface, retained draft/selection and continued keyboard input.
Run native UI drivers serially to avoid simulator accessibility contention.

`attachment-camera-chat` / `attachment-camera-sheet` exercise the production
three-action menu and inline camera page with `--ui-verify-camera`. The native
capture fixture fails the first shutter press, then creates a local image;
checks cover back/reopen, inline glass tools, flash cycling, retry, direct attachment handoff and
capture-session shutdown on page exit/dismissal. Both appearances are recorded.
This verifies UI and ownership, not physical camera hardware or sensor output.
The Photos permission cases above continue to exercise actual system prompts.
Use `--camera-access allow` or `--camera-access deny` with these same camera
cases to reset only the leased device's camera permission and exercise the real
system prompt. The returned panel must remain above the keyboard; capture on
Simulator may show the native unavailable-camera message. Never reset privacy on
a user preview device.

Attachment media geometry checks assert a 60% window-height viewport and 12 pt
side/bottom insets for photos and camera. The root menu uses 56 pt rows with
40 pt icon discs and 16 pt symbols (visually review the captured root menu).
Photo checks also cover multiline drafts and, in the chat host, a hidden keyboard.

Attachment controls share 40 pt visible height and a minimum 44 pt hit area.
The root menu uses 20 pt side and 12 pt vertical padding: its first/last icon
centers coincide with the nominal 40 pt menu corner centers. Camera checks tap
the expanded edge of the back button, outside its visible glass.

Camera capture accepts a photo directly into the draft without a review screen or
sending a message. The overlay closes into the actual attachment thumbnail using
a transient image; Reduce Motion and offscreen targets fade in place. Ownership
is transferred before animation, so cancellation cannot delete an accepted file.

Continuous attachment pages retain one outer glass panel across push/back.
The camera body and photo grid use `contentLayout: .stable` with their destination
allocation and the grid retains its scroll offset. Both expose `OverlayPageChrome` for
fixed-size foreground controls that follow the live bottom edge and safe inset.
Review `run.mp4` through entry and return in both hosts, checking for clipped
controls, scaled labels/icons and outgoing media behind incoming menu labels.
The upstream library's Reliability scene also samples rapid reversal and
same-size page changes through the public API.

Recent-photo confirmation shares the camera's draft-first thumbnail handoff.
Full-access photo cases capture single selection, clearing the last selection
(neutral All Photos), and multiple selection (system-blue Add N Items), then
verify both single and batch imports without sending a message. Review the
recording through each confirmation: the first newly accepted image represents
the batch and contracts into its actual thumbnail. Offscreen destinations and
Reduce Motion keep the library's existing in-place fade.

The overlay kit now owns external-interaction continuations, destination visibility,
menu rows, glass action buttons and bottom action-bar geometry. Keep the permission
request and media/draft ownership in Lody. Reuse `attachment-overlay-*` with both
`--photo-access full` and `--photo-access settings` to cover prompt restoration and
an actual Settings round trip in both composer hosts; the camera cases also exercise
the shared action bar with a custom shutter. Upstream Reliability checks stale
continuations, exactly-once restoration, and destination alpha on cancellation or
replacement.

The full-access attachment overlay flow also exercises the photo layout toggle in
both directions, including reversal while the corner spring is settling. Review
the screenshots and recording for an 18pt top panel radius in inset mode
(6pt photo radius + 12pt inset), restored 40pt in edge-to-edge mode, and the
same inset corners after reopening the page. Bottom corners remain device-concentric.
The flow runs in
both composer hosts and appearances. It checks 12pt margins on all four edges,
edge-to-edge restoration, a saved layout after the page stack is recreated,
selection retention, and the visible photo anchor after switching while scrolled.
The Photos fixture includes enough rows for a real scroll. Layout controls reuse
AnchoredOverlayKit; the preference and photo layout stay in LodyKit.

`agent-error` verifies native inline alert cards, separate detail/copy actions, hidden actions for historical or incomplete failures, single-dispatch manual retry, definite rejection, accepted continuation, compact content-driven height, stable pending action geometry and preserved composer drafts in both appearances. Its retry service is local; no cloud turn is sent. Set `LODY_VERIFY_RUNTIME` to an installed Simulator runtime identifier when the default iOS 27.0 runtime is unavailable.

### Scroll edge host coverage

`--case scroll-edge-pages` exercises a production paged form with the shared native
composer: keyboard focus, page changes, and scrolling beneath the input.
`--case scroll-edge-diff` exercises the production Diff WebView and native toolbar
in Unified and Split modes, waiting for document-render completion before capture.
Review the bottom edge fade (Diff) and soft-edge (paged form) screenshots in both appearances; passing accessibility checks
alone does not establish the blur's visual correctness. Native file/service
fixtures activate under `--ui-verify` in Debug and Release fixture builds.

### Continuous steer

`--case steer` opens an offline scene backed by the execution projector and NativeChat.
It covers three accepted guidance messages, the completed user-message sequence above
one AI process summary, both final text blocks, and opening the earlier AI process.
Runtime checks separately exercise stale ACK/history and unavailable provider evidence.

### Single-message paper sharing

`--case message-share` opens an independently resettable offline message scene.
It checks the native metadata menu, complete Markdown copy, system text/image
sharing, the same JPEG used by preview and export, paragraph/block selection and select all/none, long replies, image attachments,
missing model metadata, export-size and image-loading errors, and temporary-file
cleanup on dismissal. It records light/dark screenshots and video and retains
actual `*-export.jpg` files for visual inspection. The paper itself remains warm
white in both appearances. The 1080 px export is capped at 12000 px high and fails
explicitly rather than truncating. Fixture image loading does not prove live
cloud authorization or third-party share destinations.

### Opened session trees

`session-tree` and `session-tree-pad` open an independently resettable Debug scene
using production session projections and the iPhone grouped list / iPad sidebar.
They verify two-level expansion, separate title navigation, collapsed count and
attention summary, retention across catalog updates and project collapse, and
filtered children remaining reachable without their opener. Light/dark screenshots
and video cover both hosts. Service data is offline; this does not establish live
cloud synchronization. Session trees use `openedBySessionId`; contained Tabs and
transcript `subagent_task` items retain their existing UI.

`--suite camera` exercises the attachment overlay camera in both composer hosts,
using the same checks as `attachment-camera-chat` and `attachment-camera-sheet`.
The explicit `--ui-verify-camera` launch fixture supplies a local image and rejects
the first shutter press. The checks cover retry, flash/lens controls, direct
attachment handoff, cancellation and foreground ownership. Screenshots and video
cover the continuous menu/container transition. Share Extension retains its system
attachment sheet because the keyboard overlay requires application-only APIs;
its shared capture service is compiled into both targets.
`verify:native --case composer` also checks JPEG storage, invalid input, overlay
viewport resizing and ChatKit attachment handoff geometry/cleanup. Real camera
preview, orientation, focus, flash and lens switching require iPhone validation;
the fixture does not establish their hardware behavior.

`--suite paste-plain` checks the native Paste as Plain Text menu in chat and the
new-session composer, in English light/dark appearances. It verifies that long
text stays inline and records menu/result screenshots and video. The native
composer check also covers mixed text/image/RTF clipboard representations, selected
text replacement and unavailable actions for nontext or read-only inputs.

`message-details` uses the offline message fixture to verify the native collection-view
Sheet, recorded configuration, exact token breakdown, absent metadata, late usage
updates while open and the independent message-action menu in English light/dark
appearances. Screenshots and video cover the states; no cloud turn is sent.

`simulator-preview` uses the production preview hook, full-screen host, floating
chat host and JPEG decoder with a local native frame source. It checks that the
same renderer and connection survive return/expand, dragging stays within the
chat, the keyboard stays clear, drafts survive, and close/reopen creates a fresh
stream. Light/dark screenshots and video cover the transitions. This fixture
requires neither cloud access nor a connected computer; it does not prove the
remote tunnel's availability or background network continuity.
`pnpm verify:native --case simulator-transport` separately exercises the production
native transport against a loopback werift peer (the CLI gateway's WebRTC stack)
over real DTLS/SCTP, plus a loopback WebSocket server: bounded frame reassembly,
acknowledged controls, disconnect without replaying uncertain commands,
old/malformed/redirecting signaling fallback, and close during negotiation. It
uses synthetic HTTP signaling and does not establish live TURN, cross-network
latency or compatibility with a deployed CLI version.
Left/right/down swipes inside the device must not dismiss Preview. A slow border
swipe must visibly shrink and move the device while held, then cancel without
replacing the decoder. A longer edge swipe must track touch before completing
into the PiP. The check measures decoded-frame pixels in intermediate screenshots
because UIKit's transition container leaves the renderer's own layer/AX geometry
unchanged. It also changes the selected device, stops sharing, and re-enters the
chat; the fixture's active-source counter must stay at one, so an abandoned
renderer cannot keep running unnoticed.
Native presentation-layer traces verify fade blur in on each return, removal of
the entrance blur, and no replay during dragging or keyboard layout changes.

`--case attachment-overlay-create` additionally exercises the production native
`CreateSessionController` form: photo authorization, keyboard coverage, attachment
handoff and draft preservation. It uses the offline create-parity fixture and full
Photos access.

Camera entry checks sample the production page during the panel transition: the
viewfinder allocation must remain fixed while the visible panel changes height.
Initial preview orientation is configured before capture starts, with implicit
preview geometry animations disabled. Actual sensor startup/orientation still
requires iPhone verification. Authorized photo selection checks capture both selected top
corners, partial scrolling and inset mode to review the continuous theme-accent outline
and opaque white selection numbers.

For photo selection visual checks independent of the system authorization
continuation, use `--photo-access granted`. The runner grants Photos access only
on its leased Simulator and runs focused layout, selection, scrolling and
attachment checks through `attachment-selection.py`. This mode does not establish permission-prompt restoration;
use the existing `full`/`limited`/`denied`/`settings` modes for that contract.

`attachment-motion-chat`, `attachment-motion-sheet` and `attachment-motion-create`
record the same menu open → camera → back → photos → back → close/reopen flow.
They use granted fixture photos and the deterministic camera, retain the draft,
and check that the viewfinder keeps its destination size during transitions.
Run with `--require-video` and omit `--appearance` for light/dark coverage.
`motion-events.json` records wall-clock action boundaries for trimming idle waits
from before/after clips; preserve original playback speed and inspect the frames.

`workspace-changes` opens the shared production overflow actions, then the workspace
list and current-file diff. It covers refresh failure, retry and successful empty
results in English light/dark with screenshots and video. `simulator-preview`
now enters through that same overflow menu. Both use offline service fixtures;
they do not prove availability of a deployed Machine. Workspace changes use the
Machine All Changes comparison base, displayed in the list, and may include
committed branch changes as well as uncommitted files.

`--suite permission-composer` runs `permission-mode-chat`,
`permission-mode-sheet`, and `permission-mode-create`. These exercise the shared composer permission menu with offline agent options in both
appearances. They check 44 pt controls, separation from mentions/model controls,
selection round trips, menu reopening, and retained drafts. The runtime regression
checks persistence before RPC and restoration from history; no live agent turn is
sent by these UI fixtures.

### Library-owned selection boundary

`ChatRecentPhotosView` adopts `OverlayBoundaryHighlighting` and returns selected
visible image regions with the collection view as `clippedTo`. Lody keeps the
ordered selection, badges and each photo's own border. AnchoredOverlayKit owns
the panel-edge stroke, live corners, coordinate conversion and clipping; there
is no app-owned boundary view, shape mask or scroll/layout refresh callback.

The app pins the published `@rien7/anchored-overlay-kit@0.3.0` package.
The temporary 0.2.0 dependency patch has been removed; CocoaPods resolves the
released Swift sources from node_modules.

Reuse `attachment-overlay-chat`, `attachment-overlay-sheet` and
`attachment-overlay-create` with `--photo-access granted --embedded` to verify
selection at both top corners, repeated edge/inset layout switching, partially
scrolled selection, renumbering and draft-preserving import in both appearances.
Review the screenshots and videos for border continuity and stale highlights.
